## Overview

This repo contains some templates for creating and executing a discrete choice experiment as a tool for teaching consumer theory. During the first couple of weeks in a typical Intermediate Microeconomics course, students are introduced to the concepts of consumer choice and preferences. Leaving students asking: "but how do these concepts relate to a demand curve?"

Using tired examples of goods that people can purchase at a store (or hypothetical widgets) does a pretty poor job of mapping preferences to demand. Put yourself in the shoes of the student, preferences are still pretty foreign at this point and students tend to relate preferences to having or not having money for something. For example, students at this stage have an image that if a person wants a soda at a given price, they will buy it. Asking students to trace a demand curve for this type of "market" good is not likely to turn on any lightbulbs. To abstract away from retail prices (where people simply face a given price) I like to introduce the concept of "nonmarket" goods (i.e. things you cannot buy at the store). Cue the discrete choice experiment! 

## Learning Topics

1. Consumer theory: choices, preferences, axioms (complete, transitive, continuous, non-satiation)
2. Marginal utility and marginal rates of substitution
4. Demand curves and WTP distributions across populations

## Workflow

The general workflow goes as follows: 

- Introduce consumer theory and willingness to pay (WTP) curves
  - This should include the derivation of marginal utility and marginal rates of substitution. Setting the stage for MWTP as the ratio of two preference parameters: <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?MU_{x}/MU_{\$}" /> 
- Using the templates in this game: 
  - Randomly assign an annual household income to students
  - Link students to the online choice experiment (I use Qualtrics, but any online survey platform will work. However, the generating and cleaning scripts provided here are set up to integrate into Qualtrics)
  - Export the responses from Qualtrics and prepare the data for in-class analysis
  - Run regressions that estimate MWTP and plot demand curves
    - I do this in real time in class (it takes seconds to run) as it is also a good opportunity to introduce students to statistical software (after which many will come and ask for research assistantships, neat!) 

## Generate Student Incomes 

Generating annual household incomes for your students provides a budget constraint that is not correlated with their current ramen noodle budget. Depending on which learning management system you use for your class (Blackboard, etc.), you might need to import your roster differently. The example roster `store\student_roster.xlsx` provided here is a typical roster exported from Blackboard, but adjust as needed. 

- Script: `1_generate_incomes.do`
  - Input: `student_roster.xlsx`
  - Output: `student_incomes.csv`
  
This script randomly assigns incomes to students using a modified beta distribution (trying to mimic real-world income distributions, which makes for a fun side conversation about how income is not randomly assigned in the real world). The income assignment will result in some students being really rich, and other students being really poor (it is also fun to have them guess the moments of income distribution before sharing in class). Their choices (and subsequent WTP) should reflect this. The script also generates the necessary contact information (email) and external data (income) that will be read by Qualtrics. 

## The Online Choice Experiement

Setting up the online choice experiment can be done at any time; however, when using Qualtrics, the `student_incomes.csv` file (the output of `1_generate_incomes.do`) will be an input for the online Qualtrics survey. The ordering and wording of the questions is outlined in `2_survey_questions.docx`. The introduction and post-survey questions are simply plain text. The choice questions themselves are in HTML and will call the image of the choice question in real time from any designated server. For this example, I use AWS S3 as the host for the image, although this can be done using any hosting service (although AWS is fast and reliable). I have also included the file `survey.docx` where you can make changes to any piece of the survey, and export the pages of the revised survey as images. In turn, piping the new images (your new choice questions) into the Qualtrics survey.

One thing to note is that the choice experiment provided in this example is not an 'efficient' design. Meaning, the levels of the attributes are not orthogonal. This is intentional. I have incorporated two concepts of consumer theory into the choice experiment: 1) transitivity, and 2) strictly dominated alternatives. This allows the instructor to test if students were paying attention (and call the ones out who clearly were not... just kidding, maybe), but also to reiterate axioms of choice and how they can be observed in the real world. More on this below. 

### Choice Questions

In the document `2_survey_questions.docx` I have provided text that you can copy and paste into your own Qualtrics survey. In the first intructions section, you will notice that the `ExternalDataReference` is being piped in from the spreadsheet that you upload to Qualtrics. The spreadsheet that you generated in the previous step (`student_incomes.csv`) is uploaded as the contact list (distribution list) for Qualtrics and will send students an email inviting them to take the survey. At some point I will walk you all through how to do this, but it is pretty straightforward, just follow the instructions on Qualtrics for uploading an existing contact list.

### Transitivity

There are three scenarios in the survey that are the same across choice cards. This allows us to rank preferences such that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?A\succsim%20B\succsim%20C" />. These particular bundles are not strictly dominated by other bundles and any combination of preference relations could be perfectly rational. However, we can test the students' choices by exploiting the weak axiom of revealed preferences (WARP). This doesn't really matter other than to say something along the lines of "seven student's chocies were not consistent with preferences exhibiting the property of transitivity."

Moreover: 

  - Preference bundle <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?A="/> Scenario A on Choice Card 1 and Scenario B on Choice Card 2
  - Preference bundle <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?B="/> Scenario B on Choice Card 1 and Scenario A on Choice Card 4
  - Preference bundle <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?C="/> Scenario A on Choice Card 2 and Scenario B on Choice Card 4

 ### Strictly Dominated Alternatives

Choice card number 3 includes the choice between Scenario A and Scenario B, where Scenario B is strictly dominated by Scenario A. It is perfectly rational for a student to choose the No Change option, but the only policy scenario that would be rational is Scenario A as it includes attributes that are all more improved at a lower cost than Scenario B. Again, you can call out students who were clearly not paying attention (do not actually do this, just let them know that you know). 

### Other Fun Built-ins

The way this is structured will also allow us to explore how preferences vary with personal characteristics (preference heterogeneity). The post-survey questions allow for an interaction between the choice attributes and income, industry, and recreation behavior. Choice card number 5 also has a scenario that is extremely expensive but the quality of the river is such that you can drink it. It is fun to look at how much students are WTP to drink the river (and if their desire to drink the river is correlated with with income or other personal characteristics).  

## Analyze

Now that you have all this class-specific data (important for connecting your students to the lesson), what are you going to do with it!? Same thing we always do, run a regression, yay! First we need to export the data from Qualtrics (done online) and prepare it for the in-class analysis using the provided cleaning script. 

- Script: `3_clean_qualtrics_data.do`
  - Input: `qualtrics_data.csv`
  - Output: `cleaned_data.dta`
 
After we have prepared the students' choice data, we can use the script `4_lecture.do` during class to summarize and analyze the students' choices. There are many things we can do with the data and I have provided code for a few of the concepts I would present during lecture (in order).

### In-class Summaries

- Income distribution: Summarizes student income and plots the CDF. I usually have the students guess min, max, median and then run the code.
- Transitivity: Summarizes the proportion of students whose preferences exhibit transitivity. 
  - Characteristics that explain transitivity: I run regression exploring if income explains transitivity. 
- Dominated alternatives: Summarizes the proportion of students who chose the strictly dominated alternative. 
  - Characteristics that explain who chose the dominated alternative: I run a regression exploring if income or if time spent on the survey explains which students chose the strictly dominated alternative.
- Characteristics that explain who chose to drink the river: I run a regression exploring if income or if recreation behavior explains which students chose the alternative that included water quality as drinkable.

### Estimate Utility Functions
  
To estimate the students' utility functions, I use the user-written command `mixlogit` (Hole, 2013). There are others, and for demonstration purposes you could even get by with a simple OLS, but `mixlogit` is more consistent in practice and also allows for random parameters that make for more interesting discussion with the students. Write out a utility function on the board without parameters. Then add parameters (betas, etc.), then add epsilon and explain variation in consumer tastes. Explain that in running the regression, we are simply solving for the partial derivatives of the utility function. Each parameter can, therefore, be interpreted as a marginal utility. What is the ratio of two marginal utilities? The marginal rate of substitution. What is that ratio when the denominator is the parameter associated with the cost attribute? The marginal willingess to substitute money for the attribute, or more directly, the marginal willingness to pay! Voila!  

Examples included:
  - Simple model with no interactions
  - Simple model with `fish` and `rural` interacted (are rural students willing to pay more or less for fish than their urban classmates?)
  
### Demand Plots

Examples included: 
  - Simple summary of WTP for for each attribute (fish, birds, swimming in the river, and drinking the river)
  - Plot distribution (kernel density) of WTP for each attribute
  - Plot demand curves for each attribute
